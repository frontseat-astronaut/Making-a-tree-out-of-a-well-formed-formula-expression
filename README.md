# Making-a-tree-out-of-a-well-formed-formula-expression
Currently, the program takes in a well formed formula (propositional logic) as a String and forms a formula tree out of it, containing propositions and operators as nodes.
I've also made a class for valuation, which stores the values of the propositions, and a function in the tree that checks if the given valuation satisfies the wff or not.

Run the main.java file, enter the formula as String, enter the valuation and see if it satisfies the given formula!
Supports conjunction, disjunction, implies, Double implies and of course, not.
