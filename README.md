# Making-a-tree-out-of-a-well-formed-formula-expression
Currently, the program takes in a well formed formula (propositional logic) as a String and forms a formula tree out of it, containing propositions and operators as nodes.
I've also made a class for valuation for these propositions, but am yet to make a use of it.

Run the main.java file and enter the formula as String.
